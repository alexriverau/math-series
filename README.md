### Description

The Fibonacci Series is a numeric series starting with the integers 0 and 1. In this series, the next integer is determined by summing the previous two.

* `fibonacci(n)` returns the nth value in the Fibonacci Series. 

The Lucas Numbers are a related series of integers that start with the values 2 and 1 rather than 0 and 1.
  * `lucas(n)` returns the nth value in the Lucas Numbers.
  
The function `sum_series()` takes in one required parameter and two optional. The required parameter will determine which element in the series to print. The two optional parameters will have default values of 0 and 1 and will determine the first two values for the series to be produced.
